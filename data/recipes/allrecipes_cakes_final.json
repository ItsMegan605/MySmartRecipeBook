Add in half of the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add ricotta cheese and mix until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture, stirring until just combined.\n\nAdd 1/3 of the whipped egg whites to the batter, and fold until no streaks of egg whites remain. Gently fold in remaining egg whites until no streaks of egg whites remain. Pour batter evenly over pineapple slices, and gently smooth into an even layer.\n\nPlace cake pan into the preheated oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out with a few moist crumbs, 50 to 55 minutes.\n\nAllow cake to cool in the pan 10 minutes before running a knife around the sides to loosen. Invert cake onto a serving platter and let pan sit for a few minutes on top of the cake before removing. Allow cake to cool before serving.",

Don't let it get grainy looking though. Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a spatula occasionally to remove any lumps.\n\nSlice the cooled cake horizontally into three layers. Arrange strawberries on the bottom layer with the top ends facing outward. Fill in the remaining space with more berries. Spoon some of the whipped cream over the berries and spread evenly.

    "preparation": "Crush about 1/4 of the strawberries with a fork; mix together with the remaining strawberries, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a medium bowl. Set aside to macerate for up to 1 hour.\n\nMeanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nWhisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix cream, eggs, and almond extract together in a separate bowl.\n\nCut cold butter cubes into the flour mixture using a pastry cutter until texture resembles damp sand. Make a well in the center and pour in the cream mixture; fold it in gently with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.\n\nTurn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times until dough comes together. Pat out until 1/2-inch thick. Fold dough in half and then in quarters, and pat out into a 1/2-inch thickness again. Repeat folding one more time.\n\nCut out 12 rounds using a 3-inch biscuit cutter, taking care not to twist the cutter in the dough, and place at least 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Brush the tops of the biscuits with melted butter and sprinkle with sanding sugar.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.\n\nCombine heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla bean paste in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat on medium speed until stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes.\n\nSplit the shortcakes in half and top with macerated strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream.",

Carefully unroll the cooled cake onto the plastic wrap.\n\nSpread filling over the cake, re-roll the cake (without the towel), and wrap carefully with plastic wrap. Transfer the filled cake, seam-side down, to a plate. Refrigerate until fully chilled, about 2 hours.",

Place the cake-in-towel on a cooling rack and let it cool completely, about 1 to 2 hours.\n\nTo make the icing: Blend cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and sugar in a medium bowl with a wooden spoon or electric mixer. Chill icing until cake has cooled.\n\nUnroll cooled cake and spread icing onto it. Immediately re-roll (not in the towel this time), and wrap it with plastic wrap. Chill the cake to set before slicing. Allrecipes Community",

It was one of the few foods that she really enjoyed and would stay down. Now my granddaughter has a gluten allergy, so I've adapted the recipe for her by using the gluten-free crust instead of the original graham crumb crust. I think I like this version better!",

Stir 1 egg yolk into crumbs until thoroughly combined and crust mixture holds its shape when pressed.\n\nMove a rack to the center position in oven. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\n\nSpray a 10-inch springform pan with cooking spray, spread crumbs into pan, and press crumbs into a firm crust going about 1 inch up the side of the pan. Place the pan on a heavy sheet of aluminum foil and bring the foil up the sides of the pan to the rim, crumpling it close to the pan and making a barrier to prevent water from leaking into the cheesecake. Place the foil and springform pan into a large roasting pan.\n\nPlace cream cheese, 1 cup brown sugar, and white sugar into the work bowl of a large stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment; mix low speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Raise speed to high and mix until light and fluffy, about 3 more minutes.\n\nPlace pumpkin puree in a separate large mixing bowl; stir in cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, salt, vanilla extract, and bourbon whiskey until combined. Whisk 1/4 cup flour into pumpkin mixture, followed by eggs and yolks. Whisk cream cheese mixture into pumpkin mixture until filling is completely smooth and free of lumps. Pour filling into crust; use a spatula to lightly and rapidly jiggle the filling in the center of the cheesecake to help shake out any bubbles.\n\nCarefully place cheesecake in roasting pan onto center rack of oven and fill roasting pan with enough very hot (almost boiling) water to reach halfway up the side of springform pan.\n\nBake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the filling reads 155 to 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Check temperature after 1 1/2 hours. Filling will still be slightly jiggly in the center.\n\nTurn off oven heat and open oven door for a few seconds to let out most of the hot air. Use a thin knife to separate cheesecake edge from inside of pan to help prevent cracking. Close oven door almost all the way, leaving a small opening (about 1 inch) to release additional heat. Let cheesecake cool in warm oven for 1 hour to finish setting. Remove cheesecake from water bath and let cool to room temperature on a counter, 2 to 3 more hours. Cover cheesecake with aluminum foil and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 3 hours but preferably overnight.\n\nUse a folded paper towel to remove any moisture that has formed on top of the cheesecake before releasing and carefully lifting the pan from the cheesecake.",

Beat in vanilla extract.\n\nPour about 1/2 of the batter into a different bowl and set aside.\n\nAdd pumpkin puree and pumpkin spice to the batter in the stand mixer bowl and mix until combined.\n\nTransfer 1/4 cup of the plain batter into a piping bag or plastic storage bag. Spread the rest over the pie crust. Top with the pumpkin cheesecake batter.\n\nPipe remaining plain batter into 5 concentric circles on the top of the cheesecake. Drag the tip of a toothpick or small knife out from the center of the batter to the edge, wiping it down between each pull, to create a spider web effect.\n\nPlace the springform pan in the bottom of a roasting pan; fill roasting pan halfway up with warm water to create a water bath.\n\nCarefully transfer cheesecake to the oven and bake until edges are set, top is no longer shiny, and center is still a little jiggly, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.\n\nTurn the oven off and prop the door open at least 4 inches. Leave the cheesecake in the oven for an additional 30 minutes.\n\nRemove cheesecake from the oven and water bath. Run a knife around the edge to prevent sticking and cool on a cooling rack for 30 minutes more. Cover loosely and chill for at least 6 hours, or overnight.\n\nRun a knife around the edge of the pan and carefully remove the sides of the springform pan. Slice and serve.",

    "preparation": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees.\n\nHeat butter and sugar in a saucepan until butter melts. Meanwhile, line the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with a 12-by-20-inch sheet of foil so it hangs over the long sides of the pan (you'll use this as a 'handle' to pull the cooked dessert from the pan). Arrange graham crackers over foil-lined pan bottom, cutting the final few with a knife so they'll fit snugly. Pour butter mixture over crackers; spread with knife to cover. Bake until butter-sugar mixture starts to harden, about 7 minutes. Remove from oven. Reduce temperature to 300 degrees.\n\nAs crust bakes, heat pumpkin, 1 1/4 cups brown sugar and spices in a medium pan over medium-high heat until mixture is sputtery hot. Process eggs on high speed in a blender. Transfer pumpkin to a pourable container. With blender running, slowly add pumpkin mixture; puree until smooth. Add cream cheese, one block at a time; puree until smooth. Pour mixture over crust; bake until set, about 35 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, mix sour cream, remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar and vanilla. Remove cheesecake from oven. Pour sour cream mixture evenly over top; carefully spread so top is completely covered. Return to oven. Bake to set topping, about 5 minutes longer. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate (can be made up to 2 days ahead).\n\nTo serve, run a knife around the pan perimeter to loosen cake. Use foil handles to pull cake from pan. Cut into squares (up to 15) and garnish with optional pecans.",

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nWhisk together flour, white sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt for biscuits in a large bowl. Add butter and stir until coated. Cut in butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse, wet sand. (It should hold together when squeezed, then crumble away.)\n\nWhisk together buttermilk, egg, and vanilla in a small bowl; pour into the flour mixture and quickly stir with a fork. When mixture begins to hold together, transfer to a floured surface.\n\nKnead just until a dough ball forms. Press into a 7x10-inch rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Fold into thirds, then press into a 5x7-inch rectangle about 1 inch thick.\n\nCut dough into 8 biscuits and arrange 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with whipping cream and sprinkle with coarse sugar.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack. Let cool about 15 minutes.\n\nSlice biscuits in half; serve with filling and whipped cream.",

In another mixing bowl, beat the white and brown sugars, vegetable oil, melted butter, applesauce, vanilla, pumpkin, and eggs together until smooth.\n\nGradually beat the flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, until completely smooth and well blended. Pour the batter into the prepared Bundt pan.\n\nBake in preheated oven for 60 minutes. Cover cake with aluminum foil to prevent over-browning, and bake until a wooden skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for about half an hour.\n\nTo unmold the cake, tap the bottom of the Bundt pan on the counter or work surface to help release it. Invert the cake on a serving plate and allow it to cool completely before glazing.\n\nTo make the glaze, mix the cream cheese with the butter, confectioners' sugar, rum extract, and milk in a bowl. Heat in a microwave oven for 15 seconds. Drizzle spoonfuls over the cooled cake. Keep cake refrigerated after serving.",

Stir until chocolate is smooth and no more lumps remain.\n\nBeat butter with an electric mixer on medium speed in a mixing bowl until fluffy. Beat in half the confectioners' sugar, melted white chocolate chips, and milk until mixture is smooth and creamy.\n\nSlowly beat in remaining confectioners' sugar until smooth; if frosting is too stiff, beat in more milk, 1 teaspoon at a time.\n\nSpread or pipe the white chocolate frosting over the cupcakes to cover the raspberry filling; drizzle or pipe any remaining raspberry filling over the cupcakes.",

    "presentation": "Being a big fan of Mexican hot chocolate, I just love the slight accent flavor of cinnamon in chocolate. This recipe for chocolate cake evolved with experimentation as I figured out how to achieve a light fluffy cake and infused it with a hint of coffee and cinnamon. Coffee enhances the flavor of cocoa powder, resulting in a more chocolaty cake. Cocoa powder is bitter on its own, with hints of fruit and spice that are detectable when you get a good-quality cocoa. Coffee has these same flavor elements, and a small amount of coffee in the batter will help these cocoa flavors stand out even more than they would on their own. Cinnamon adds another layer of richness that complements the underlying spice flavors in cocoa. Add a dollop of blackberry preserves in the center of the cupcakes.",

    "preparation": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup standard cupcake pans with paper liners.\n\nWhisk flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.\n\nCombine sugars and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, thoroughly mixing after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract.\n\nMix 1/3 of the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just combined. Mix in 1/2 of the coffee and 1/2 of the sour cream until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture alternately with remaining sour cream and coffee. Do not overmix. Fill the prepared cupcake cups evenly with batter.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until they spring back lightly when touched, 18 to 22 minutes. Let cool completely, 30 minutes to 1 hour.\n\nCore cooled cupcakes using a knife or cupcake corer, cutting about halfway down. Save cupcake centers for another use (such as for making a batch of cake balls).\n\nPrepare ganache. Add white chocolate chips and heavy cream to a large, microwave-safe bowl. Heat at 50% power until chocolate is melted and smooth, in 30-second intervals, stirring after each. Mix in crushed candies and peppermint extract until thoroughly combined. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, stirring often.\n\nPlace ganache in a piping bag or resealable plastic bag with a corner cut off. Fill each cupcake to the top with ganache. Allow them to sit until ganache firms up and doesn't \"smudge\" when pressed lightly with fingertips, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nPrepare frosting. Cream butter until smooth in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in 1 cup powdered sugar at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract, peppermint extract, and salt. Add heavy cream and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. If frosting is too thick, add more heavy cream--or if it is too thin, add more powdered sugar until frosting is a spreadable consistency that still holds its shape.\n\nPlace a small amount of frosting in a separate bowl and add yellow food coloring for the ear muffs. Divide remaining frosting in half. To 1/2 of the divided frosting, add cocoa powder and red food coloring to achieve an auburn color. Divide remaining white frosting in half again. Color 1/2 peach using a very light amount of red and yellow food coloring. Color remaining frosting red. Put each into a piping bag fitted with a coupler.\n\nArrange cupcakes on a large cake board or serving platter, starting from the top. Begin with 1 cupcake at the top. Follow with a row of 2 cupcakes, making sure they stay as close as possible. (If cupcakes slide around, affix a small amount of frosting to the bottom of them so they stick to the serving platter or cake board.) Follow with a row of 3 cupcakes, then a row of 5 cupcakes, a row of 4 cupcakes, another row of 5 cupcakes, and finally a last row of 4 cupcakes. Make sure the cupcakes are as close to one another as possible. If there are any large gaps, you can use large marshmallows, trimmed to fit, in order to fill them in and make a flatter, more cohesive surface to frost.\n\nBeginning with the top 6 cupcakes (the rows with 1 cupcake, 2 cupcakes, and 3 cupcakes in them), frost the hat portion of the cake using the red frosting and large round tip. Smooth center portion using an offset spatula, if desired. Use the peach frosting to frost the center 3 cupcakes in the row of 5 below the hat, leaving a cupcake on each side unfrosted for the ear muffs. Smooth with an offset spatula. Affix 2 dark chocolate chips upside-down for the eyes in the center of the peach frosting.\n\nPipe the nose below the eyes, and then the lower lip below the nose using the peach frosting. Frost the cupcakes on each side of the face with the yellow frosting for the ear muffs. To frost the beard, use the auburn colored frosting and cover the remaining unfrosted cupcakes (that contain a row of 4, a row of 5, and final row of 4 cupcakes) with a thin layer of the auburn frosting. Smooth frosting all over the \"beard-portion\" of the cupcakes until mostly smooth and flat. Place a star tip on the auburn frosting piping bag, and pipe dots of frosting along the side of the face, then pipe the mustache between the nose and lip, and add some swirls on top of the beard, if desired.\n\nAllow cupcake cake to sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature (or place in the fridge) to allow frosting to crust. Serve.",

    "presentation": "I'm very excited about this mini chocolate cupcake recipe. It saves time, money, and most of all, butter! I love using butter for cupcakes but it's pricey and you may notice your cupcake is a little dense if it's sitting out for a while. This recipe contains extra-virgin olive oil and no coffee. Use good quality cocoa powder because I do notice a difference when using generic. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do! Happy baking!",

Stir continuously, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.\n\nRemove the eyes from the freezer and individually pick them up with a toothpick. Dip balls into melted chocolate leaving a small circle on one side blank. Twirl the toothpick to remove excess chocolate and put back on the parchment lined baking sheet.\n\nDig out a bit of the peanut butter mixture from each ball where it isn't covered with chocolate to make room for the red decorating gel. Fill the holes with red decorating gel.\n\nFrost cupcakes with chocolate frosting. Place 2 peanut butter eyes on top. Draw on a mouth with the white decorating gel.",

    "preparation": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup standard cupcake pans with paper liners.\n\nWhisk flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.\n\nCombine sugars and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, thoroughly mixing after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract.\n\nMix 1/3 of the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just combined. Mix in 1/2 of the coffee and 1/2 of the sour cream until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture alternately with remaining sour cream and coffee. Do not overmix. Fill the prepared cupcake cups evenly with batter.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until they spring back lightly when touched, 18 to 22 minutes. Let cool completely, 30 minutes to 1 hour.\n\nCore cooled cupcakes using a knife or cupcake corer, cutting about halfway down. Save cupcake centers for another use (such as for making a batch of cake balls).\n\nPrepare ganache. Add white chocolate chips and heavy cream to a large, microwave-safe bowl. Heat at 50% power until chocolate is melted and smooth, in 30-second intervals, stirring after each. Mix in crushed candies and peppermint extract until thoroughly combined. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, stirring often.\n\nPlace ganache in a piping bag or resealable plastic bag with a corner cut off. Fill each cupcake to the top with ganache. Allow them to sit until ganache firms up and doesn't \"smudge\" when pressed lightly with fingertips, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nPrepare frosting. Cream butter until smooth in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in 1 cup powdered sugar at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract, peppermint extract, and salt. Add heavy cream and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. If frosting is too thick, add more heavy cream--or if it is too thin, add more powdered sugar until frosting is a spreadable consistency that still holds its shape.\n\nPlace a small amount of frosting in a separate bowl and add yellow food coloring for the ear muffs. Divide remaining frosting in half. To 1/2 of the divided frosting, add cocoa powder and red food coloring to achieve an auburn color. Divide remaining white frosting in half again. Color 1/2 peach using a very light amount of red and yellow food coloring. Color remaining frosting red. Put each into a piping bag fitted with a coupler.\n\nArrange cupcakes on a large cake board or serving platter, starting from the top. Begin with 1 cupcake at the top. Follow with a row of 2 cupcakes, making sure they stay as close as possible. (If cupcakes slide around, affix a small amount of frosting to the bottom of them so they stick to the serving platter or cake board.) Follow with a row of 3 cupcakes, then a row of 5 cupcakes, a row of 4 cupcakes, another row of 5 cupcakes, and finally a last row of 4 cupcakes. Make sure the cupcakes are as close to one another as possible. If there are any large gaps, you can use large marshmallows, trimmed to fit, in order to fill them in and make a flatter, more cohesive surface to frost.\n\nBeginning with the top 6 cupcakes (the rows with 1 cupcake, 2 cupcakes, and 3 cupcakes in them), frost the hat portion of the cake using the red frosting and large round tip. Smooth center portion using an offset spatula, if desired. Use the peach frosting to frost the center 3 cupcakes in the row of 5 below the hat, leaving a cupcake on each side unfrosted for the ear muffs. Smooth with an offset spatula. Affix 2 dark chocolate chips upside-down for the eyes in the center of the peach frosting.\n\nPipe the nose below the eyes, and then the lower lip below the nose using the peach frosting. Frost the cupcakes on each side of the face with the yellow frosting for the ear muffs. To frost the beard, use the auburn colored frosting and cover the remaining unfrosted cupcakes (that contain a row of 4, a row of 5, and final row of 4 cupcakes) with a thin layer of the auburn frosting. Smooth frosting all over the \"beard-portion\" of the cupcakes until mostly smooth and flat. Place a star tip on the auburn frosting piping bag, and pipe dots of frosting along the side of the face, then pipe the mustache between the nose and lip, and add some swirls on top of the beard, if desired.\n\nAllow cupcake cake to sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature (or place in the fridge) to allow frosting to crust. Serve.",

Stir in 1/2 cup sugar until combined. Let sit, loosely covered, at room temperature for 10 days, stirring once each day. The color should change and mixture should foam when stirred.\n\nDay Twenty: Slice each maraschino cherry in half and add to starter mixture. Stir in remaining 2 1/2 cups sugar until combined. Let sit, loosely covered, at room temperature for the final 10 days, stirring once each day. The color will turn slightly pink from the cherries.\n\nDay Thirty: Drain liquid from fruit and pour into 3 glass or ceramic pint jars — one for you to make your next cake and two for friends. Set aside fruit.\n\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x13-inch baking dishes.\n\nBeat together 1 box cake mix, 4 eggs, 2/3 cup oil, and 1 package instant pudding in a large bowl until well combined. Mix in 1/2 of the reserved fruit. Stir in 1 cup raisins, 1 cup nuts, and 1 cup coconut until incorporated; batter will be stiff. Pour into the prepared baking dish.

Once steaming, add 1/2 of it to the egg mixture, whisking constantly to avoid scrambling the eggs. Add that mixture back into the hot cream mixture and continue to heat and stir until custard is very thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the reserved raspberry pulp. Let sit until cooled to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Place parchment or waxed paper over the surface to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the sides and bottoms of two 9-inch round, metal or glass cake pans.\n\nPrepare cake: Blend cake mix, water, oil, and eggs in a large bowl at low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Beat at medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pans.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove cakes from the pans and cool completely, about 15 to 20 more minutes.\n\nPrepare the frosting: Beat butter and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl on medium speed until creamy. Beat in melted white chocolate. Add vanilla and beat on low speed, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl, until light and fluffy. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a #18 star tip.\n\nLevel the tops of the cooled cake layers with a large serrated knife. Pipe a small amount of frosting onto the center of a serving plate. Put one layer, cut-side down, on the plate. Pipe a thick ring around the top edge of that layer; this will keep the filling in the cake and prevent the layers from sliding. Spread raspberry pastry cream onto the cake. Place to remaining layer, cut-side down, on top. Frost the top and sides with remaining frosting, decorating as desired.\n\nHold white chocolate bar in one hand with a paper towel (to stop it from melting in your hand). Use a vegetable peeler and slowly and carefully shave along the length of the bar to form pretty curls. Put chocolate curls on the sides of the cake and place raspberries in a ring around the top edge.",

Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake 35 minutes longer.\n\nRemove cake from the oven and remove the back of the mold. Allow lamb to cool in face half of mold for about 5 minutes. Loosen cake from sides of mold and remove carefully. Stand lamb cake upright on cake rack until cool. When cool, frost with snow frosting and cover with coconut.\n\nTo make Snow Frosting: Combine egg white, sugar, dash of salt, water, and light corn syrup in the top of a small double boiler; beat with rotary egg beater about 1 minute or until thoroughly mixed. Cook over rapidly boiling water, beating constantly with rotary egg beater 4 minutes, or until frosting stands in stiff peaks. Remove from boiling water, add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and beat 1 minute, or until thick enough to spread.",

When I got up Christmas morning, a fourth of it had already been eaten. Serve all by itself or with ice cream and/or fruit.",

Apply glaze while cake is still warm. Slowly and patiently drizzle glaze over cake, including the edges and center of Bundt pan. Allow cake to cool in the pan for at least 2 hours.\n\nTo make the glaze: Combine butter, sugar, 1/4 cup water, and 1/2 cup amaretto in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, and continue to boil for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.\n\nTopping: Lightly toast slivered almonds in the oven. This will take 5 to 10 minutes. Stir frequently and be careful not to burn. Heat 1/4 cup of the prepared frosting in the microwave for 10 seconds, to soften. Place the cake on serving dish and use a spoon to drizzle the softened frosting over the cake. Scatter toasted almonds over cake before frosting cools.",

Turn off the heat and add the basil, stems and all, to the cream and allow it to steep for 1 hour. Refrigerate the cream for 3 hours or overnight. Strain and discard the basil.\n\nMeanwhile, make the sweet curry lemon curd. Use a large microwave-safe bowl: the curd will expand to twice its volume as it cooks. Whisk together the white sugar, two eggs, and curry powder until smooth. Stir in the lemon juice, lemon zest, and butter. Cook in the microwave, stirring at one-minute intervals, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. Pour the cooked curd through a sieve and refrigerate for at least three hours or until set. The mixture will have the consistency of soft pudding.\n\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with cupcake liners.\n\nCombine the white cake mix and coconut flakes in a mixing bowl. Stir in the water, three eggs, vegetable oil, and coconut extract. (For an extra-light texture, separate the egg whites from the yolks and beat the whites until medium-stiff peaks form. Fold the beaten egg whites into the cake batter.)\n\nScoop the cake batter into the prepared pans, filling the cups 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool completely.\n\nIn a chilled bowl, whip the cold basil-infused cream and 3 cups of confectioners' sugar until stiff peaks form. Refrigerate. Beat the cream cheese and remaining 3 cups of confectioners' sugar until smooth and soft. Fold in the whipped cream and mix gently until fully combined.\n\nTo decorate the cupcakes, spread a tablespoon of the lemon curd on top of each cupcake, followed by a dollop of the basil cream.

Let cool in pan at least 20 minutes or until completely cool.\n\nWhen the cake is completely cool, run a paring knife between the cake and the edge of the pan. Hold the cake pan on its side and gently tap the sides of the pan against the counter to loosen it. Cover the cake pan with a plate or cooling rack, and invert it to tip the cake out of the pan and onto the plate.\n\nTo fill and decorate, lay a cake layer onto an oven-safe plate, and spread half the lemon filling over the bottom layer. Place a second layer gently on the lemon filling, and spread the rest of the filling on the top of the second layer. Top with third layer.\n\nBeat the egg whites in a bowl until they form stiff peaks, then gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until the mixture forms a fluffy, shiny meringue. Spread the meringue all over the cake like a frosting, spreading it into decorative peaks and swirls. Place the decorated cake back into the hot oven, and bake until the peaks and swirls of meringue are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Refrigerate 4 hours to overnight, then serve cold.",

Beat the whiskey and water mixture, vegetable oil, and eggs with an electric mixer on low speed just until cake mix is moistened; increase speed to medium, and beat until the batter is smooth, about 2 minutes.

Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly, until sugar has dissolved; boil until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.\n\nWhen cakes are done baking but still hot, poke holes all over the cakes (the end of a chopstick works well for this) and drizzle the whiskey syrup into the holes. Return the cakes to the oven, and bake for an additional 5 minutes.\n\nRemove cakes from oven, allow to cool in pans for 15 minutes, then remove from pans to finish cooling on wire racks.\n\nTo make caramel sauce, mix the Irish stout beer with 1/2 cup of sugar in a saucepan over low heat. Simmer the mixture until thickened, about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, and allow to cool.\n\nTo make frosting, beat 1 cup of softened butter in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, then gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, about 1/2 cup at a time. Beat in salt, then add the Irish cream liqueur, beating until the frosting is light and fluffy.\n\nTo assemble the cake, place a layer onto a cake serving dish; pour the Irish stout caramel over the first layer, allowing the caramel to drip down the sides of the layer. Place the 2nd cake layer on top, and top with the buttercream, swirling the frosting into decorative waves. Do not frost sides of cake.",

    "preparation": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and line four 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper.\n\nCombine white cake mix, milk, egg whites, oil, and vanilla in a large bowl. Beat for 30 seconds using an electric mixer on low speed. Increase mixer speed to medium and beat for 2 more minutes. Batter will still be slightly lumpy.\n\nTo make the red cakes: Measure ½ of the cake batter into a separate bowl and whisk in red food coloring until well combined. Evenly transfer red cake batter into 2 of the prepared pans; smooth the tops with a spatula.\n\nTo make the white cake: Transfer ½ of the remaining uncolored batter into another prepared pan; smooth the top as before.\n\nTo make the blue cake: Add blue food coloring to remaining uncolored batter in the large bowl and mix until well combined; fold in 1 cup white chocolate chips until incorporated. Transfer batter to the remaining prepared pan; smooth the top.\n\nBake cakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and place onto wire racks to cool completely.\n\nRun a knife around the edges of each cooled cake. Invert cakes, remove the pans, and peel off the parchment paper. Use a sharp knife to trim the tops of cakes flat and even.\n\nCut both of the red cake layers and the white cake layer in half horizontally. You will have 4 thin red cake layers and 2 thin white cake layers.\n\nPlace a 4-inch round stencil on top of 1 thin red cake layer; cut out a 4-inch red cake round. Repeat, placing the stencil on 1 thin white cake layer to make one 4-inch white cake round. Center the 4-inch round stencil on the blue cake; cut out and remove center portion covered by the stencil to make a blue cake ring.\n\nTo assemble the cake, you will need two thin 8-inch red cake layers, one thin 8-inch white cake layer, one 4-inch thin red cake circle, one 4-inch thin white cake circle, and one blue 8-inch cake ring. Reserve the leftover thin red cake layer and other cake pieces for making crumbs for decorating.\n\nPlace one 8-inch thin red cake layer on a cake pan and frost the top generously with white frosting. Place the thin 8-inch white cake layer on top of the red one and frost the top. Place remaining 8-inch thin red cake layer atop the white one. Frost the red layer.\n\nPlace the blue ring cake on top of the 2nd red cake layer and carefully frost the inside of the blue cake ring. Gently fit the 4-inch white cake layer into the blue cake ring. Frost the top of the 4-inch white center. Place the 4-inch red cake layer on top of the white one. Gently press small cake circles flush with the top of the blue ring.\n\nFrost the entire outside of cake generously with remaining frosting.\n\nCrumble red and blue pieces of leftover cake into 2 separate bowls. Score lines into the top of the cake's frosting with a kitchen knife to make a flag design. It should have a 2-inch square at the upper left for blue field and white stars and 7 thick horizontal stripes, about 1-inch wide.\n\nFill the square field at the upper left with blue crumbs, then press 1 tablespoon white chocolate chips upside-down into the blue crumbs to make \"stars.\" Fill the bottom stripe and every other stripe with red crumbs to make red stripes. Sprinkle white sugar generously into the white stripes to make them stand out.\n\nTo serve, cut cake into wedges. The inside of the cake will reveal its layers of red and white stripes and blue field with white chocolate chip stars in every slice.",

I took my mom's great chocolate cake and added to it to create this masterpiece which recently took first place in the cake division of our city bake-off. My husband took the leftovers to a Chemistry Society meeting and they said that it was amazing and he didn't bring any back home with him.

Set aside pulp; you should have 1 cup.\n\nWhisk egg yolks, sugar, flour, and cornstarch in a bowl until completely smooth.\n\nWarm cream in a small saucepan over low heat until just hot enough to steam. Once steaming, add 1/2 of it to the egg mixture, whisking constantly to avoid scrambling the eggs. Add that mixture back into the hot cream mixture and continue to heat and stir until custard is very thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the reserved raspberry pulp. Let sit until cooled to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Place parchment or waxed paper over the surface to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the sides and bottoms of two 9-inch round, metal or glass cake pans.\n\nPrepare cake: Blend cake mix, water, oil, and eggs in a large bowl at low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Beat at medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pans.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove cakes from the pans and cool completely, about 15 to 20 more minutes.\n\nPrepare the frosting: Beat butter and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl on medium speed until creamy. Beat in melted white chocolate. Add vanilla and beat on low speed, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl, until light and fluffy. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a #18 star tip.\n\nLevel the tops of the cooled cake layers with a large serrated knife. Pipe a small amount of frosting onto the center of a serving plate. Put one layer, cut-side down, on the plate. Pipe a thick ring around the top edge of that layer; this will keep the filling in the cake and prevent the layers from sliding. Spread raspberry pastry cream onto the cake. Place to remaining layer, cut-side down, on top. Frost the top and sides with remaining frosting, decorating as desired.\n\nHold white chocolate bar in one hand with a paper towel (to stop it from melting in your hand). Use a vegetable peeler and slowly and carefully shave along the length of the bar to form pretty curls. Put chocolate curls on the sides of the cake and place raspberries in a ring around the top edge.",

Set aside pulp; you should have 1 cup.\n\nWhisk egg yolks, sugar, flour, and cornstarch in a bowl until completely smooth.\n\nWarm cream in a small saucepan over low heat until just hot enough to steam. Once steaming, add 1/2 of it to the egg mixture, whisking constantly to avoid scrambling the eggs. Add that mixture back into the hot cream mixture and continue to heat and stir until custard is very thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the reserved raspberry pulp. Let sit until cooled to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Place parchment or waxed paper over the surface to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the sides and bottoms of two 9-inch round, metal or glass cake pans.\n\nPrepare cake: Blend cake mix, water, oil, and eggs in a large bowl at low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Beat at medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pans.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove cakes from the pans and cool completely, about 15 to 20 more minutes.\n\nPrepare the frosting: Beat butter and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl on medium speed until creamy. Beat in melted white chocolate. Add vanilla and beat on low speed, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl, until light and fluffy. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a #18 star tip.\n\nLevel the tops of the cooled cake layers with a large serrated knife. Pipe a small amount of frosting onto the center of a serving plate. Put one layer, cut-side down, on the plate. Pipe a thick ring around the top edge of that layer; this will keep the filling in the cake and prevent the layers from sliding. Spread raspberry pastry cream onto the cake. Place to remaining layer, cut-side down, on top. Frost the top and sides with remaining frosting, decorating as desired.\n\nHold white chocolate bar in one hand with a paper towel (to stop it from melting in your hand). Use a vegetable peeler and slowly and carefully shave along the length of the bar to form pretty curls. Put chocolate curls on the sides of the cake and place raspberries in a ring around the top edge.",

    "preparation": "To make the sweet basil cream, heat the whipping cream in a saucepan until hot; do not boil. Turn off the heat and add the basil, stems and all, to the cream and allow it to steep for 1 hour. Refrigerate the cream for 3 hours or overnight. Strain and discard the basil.\n\nMeanwhile, make the sweet curry lemon curd. Use a large microwave-safe bowl: the curd will expand to twice its volume as it cooks. Whisk together the white sugar, two eggs, and curry powder until smooth. Stir in the lemon juice, lemon zest, and butter. Cook in the microwave, stirring at one-minute intervals, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. Pour the cooked curd through a sieve and refrigerate for at least three hours or until set. The mixture will have the consistency of soft pudding.\n\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with cupcake liners.\n\nCombine the white cake mix and coconut flakes in a mixing bowl. Stir in the water, three eggs, vegetable oil, and coconut extract. (For an extra-light texture, separate the egg whites from the yolks and beat the whites until medium-stiff peaks form. Fold the beaten egg whites into the cake batter.)\n\nScoop the cake batter into the prepared pans, filling the cups 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool completely.\n\nIn a chilled bowl, whip the cold basil-infused cream and 3 cups of confectioners' sugar until stiff peaks form. Refrigerate. Beat the cream cheese and remaining 3 cups of confectioners' sugar until smooth and soft. Fold in the whipped cream and mix gently until fully combined.\n\nTo decorate the cupcakes, spread a tablespoon of the lemon curd on top of each cupcake, followed by a dollop of the basil cream. Sprinkle with dragees.",

Mix banana and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract into batter; pour batter into the prepared pan.\n\nBeat sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, 5 eggs, milk, cream cheese, and 1 teaspoon almond extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; pour over cake batter. Cover the fluted tube pan tightly with prepared aluminum foil, sprayed-side down. Set the fluted tube pan into a large baking dish and fill the baking dish with about 2 inches of water, creating a water bath.\n\nBake in the preheated oven for 2 hours. Remove the fluted tube pan from water and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and invert cake onto a serving dish, allowing caramel topping to flow down the sides of cake.\n\nCool cake to room temperature and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Drizzle remaining caramel sauce over cake before serving.",

Add crumbs of choice and tilt pan in all directions to evenly coat, or line pan sides with ladyfingers. Tear off two long strips of heavy-duty foil, overlap in a cross pattern, and set the pan in the middle. Bring up sides, crimping around exterior top of the pan and forming a tight seal. Set it in a roasting pan large enough to hold it.\n\nBeat cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add sugar and beat on medium speed until fully incorporated. Scrape down bowl sides and beat again until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, scraping down bowl after each addition to ensure a creamy batter. Slowly beat in vanilla, then cream and sour cream. (Meanwhile, bring tea kettle of water to a boil, then turn off heat.)\n\nPour batter into prepared pan. Set the roasting pan on oven rack and pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up the side of the springform pan. Bake until cake perimeter is set but center still jiggles, about 40 minutes (some flavor variations will take longer). Turn off heat and leave oven door ajar; let cheesecake sit in oven so the residual heat continues to cook it, about 30 minutes.\n\nRemove pan from water; set on a wire rack. Let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until well-chilled, about 3 hours (can be refrigerated up to 4 days). Run a sharp knife around the edge of the pan, loosen the spring siding and serve.",

Microwave at 50% power until melted and smooth, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds.\n\nWhisk coffee liqueur and espresso granules together in a small bowl until espresso dissolves; stir into remaining batter portion. Stir melted bittersweet chocolate into coffee batter until blended.\n\nGently pour chocolate-coffee batter over plain batter in the crust; spread evenly, the pan will be very full. Place springform pan on a rimmed baking sheet.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until center is almost set but still jiggles slightly when pan gently shaken, 65 to 75 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; cool completely, about 2 hours.\n\nCover pan loosely with aluminum foil; chill 8 to 12 hours. Gently run a knife or offset spatula around the edges of the pan; remove sides of pan.\n\nAbout 1 hour before serving, heat cream and corn syrup in a small saucepan over medium just to a simmer. Place semisweet chocolate chips in a small heatproof bowl; pour cream mixture over chocolate chips and let stand 1 minute. Whisk gently until smooth. Cool slightly, about 15 minutes.\n\nPour chocolate mixture over top of cheesecake; gently spread to edge of crust. Chill until set, about 30 minutes. Garnish if desired.",

Pour melted butter in slowly and pulse until combined. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and halfway up the sides of the prepared pan.\n\nTo make the filling: Beat cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well and scraping the sides of the bowl after each addition. Beat in brown sugar, peanut butter, whipping cream, and vanilla extract until smooth, scraping the sides as needed.\n\nPour 1/2 of the filling into the prepared pan and smooth it out with a spatula. Add mini peanut butter cups in an even layer on top, then pour remaining filling over, smoothing with a spatula. Place pan in a large baking pan and fill with 1 inch hot water.\n\nSet baking pan in the middle of the preheated oven and bake until edges are puffed and surface of cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 1/2 hours. Run the tip of a table knife around the edges of the pan, set the pan on a wire rack, and allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature, about 1 hour.\n\nWhile the cheesecake is cooling, prepare the ganache: Place chocolate chips in a bowl. Heat whipping cream in a small saucepan until simmering, then pour over chocolate chips. Mix until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth. Spread ganache on top of the cheesecake.\n\nPlace cheesecake in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours before serving.",

Stir 1 egg yolk into crumbs until thoroughly combined and crust mixture holds its shape when pressed.\n\nMove a rack to the center position in oven. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\n\nSpray a 10-inch springform pan with cooking spray, spread crumbs into pan, and press crumbs into a firm crust going about 1 inch up the side of the pan. Place the pan on a heavy sheet of aluminum foil and bring the foil up the sides of the pan to the rim, crumpling it close to the pan and making a barrier to prevent water from leaking into the cheesecake. Place the foil and springform pan into a large roasting pan.\n\nPlace cream cheese, 1 cup brown sugar, and white sugar into the work bowl of a large stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment; mix low speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Raise speed to high and mix until light and fluffy, about 3 more minutes.\n\nPlace pumpkin puree in a separate large mixing bowl; stir in cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, salt, vanilla extract, and bourbon whiskey until combined. Whisk 1/4 cup flour into pumpkin mixture, followed by eggs and yolks. Whisk cream cheese mixture into pumpkin mixture until filling is completely smooth and free of lumps. Pour filling into crust; use a spatula to lightly and rapidly jiggle the filling in the center of the cheesecake to help shake out any bubbles.\n\nCarefully place cheesecake in roasting pan onto center rack of oven and fill roasting pan with enough very hot (almost boiling) water to reach halfway up the side of springform pan.\n\nBake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the filling reads 155 to 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Check temperature after 1 1/2 hours. Filling will still be slightly jiggly in the center.\n\nTurn off oven heat and open oven door for a few seconds to let out most of the hot air. Use a thin knife to separate cheesecake edge from inside of pan to help prevent cracking. Close oven door almost all the way, leaving a small opening (about 1 inch) to release additional heat. Let cheesecake cool in warm oven for 1 hour to finish setting. Remove cheesecake from water bath and let cool to room temperature on a counter, 2 to 3 more hours. Cover cheesecake with aluminum foil and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 3 hours but preferably overnight.\n\nUse a folded paper towel to remove any moisture that has formed on top of the cheesecake before releasing and carefully lifting the pan from the cheesecake.",

    "preparation": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees.\n\nHeat butter and sugar in a saucepan until butter melts. Meanwhile, line the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with a 12-by-20-inch sheet of foil so it hangs over the long sides of the pan (you'll use this as a 'handle' to pull the cooked dessert from the pan). Arrange graham crackers over foil-lined pan bottom, cutting the final few with a knife so they'll fit snugly. Pour butter mixture over crackers; spread with knife to cover. Bake until butter-sugar mixture starts to harden, about 7 minutes. Remove from oven. Reduce temperature to 300 degrees.\n\nAs crust bakes, heat pumpkin, 1 1/4 cups brown sugar and spices in a medium pan over medium-high heat until mixture is sputtery hot. Process eggs on high speed in a blender. Transfer pumpkin to a pourable container. With blender running, slowly add pumpkin mixture; puree until smooth. Add cream cheese, one block at a time; puree until smooth. Pour mixture over crust; bake until set, about 35 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, mix sour cream, remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar and vanilla. Remove cheesecake from oven. Pour sour cream mixture evenly over top; carefully spread so top is completely covered. Return to oven. Bake to set topping, about 5 minutes longer. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate (can be made up to 2 days ahead).\n\nTo serve, run a knife around the pan perimeter to loosen cake. Use foil handles to pull cake from pan. Cut into squares (up to 15) and garnish with optional pecans.",

Prick all over with a fork, then bake 15 minutes at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Allow to cool.\n\nIncrease oven temperature to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).

Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add remaining chocolate mixture, and stir until chocolate is melted.\n\nPierce chocolate cubes with a fork and dip into chocolate so it is completely covered with chocolate. Use a spoon to remove excess chocolate and place on the prepared baking sheet to set. Allow to set at room temperature.",

Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until custard begins to thicken and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 170 degrees F (76 degrees C).\n\nCombine coconut, pecans, butter, and salt in a bowl. Pour hot custard over the pecan-coconut mixture and stir until butter is melted. Cool completely to room temperature.\n\nMake the syrup by heating water and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in dark rum.\n\nCombine chopped chocolate, butter, and corn syrup in a bowl for the frosting. Heat cream in a saucepan until it just begins to boil. Remove from heat and pour into the bowl. Let stand for 1 minute, then stir until smooth and chocolate is melted. Cool to room temperature.\n\nCut cake layers in half horizontally using a serrated bread knife. Set the first cake layer on a cake plate. Brush well with syrup. Spread 3/4 cup filling on top, making sure to reach all the way to the edges. Repeat with remaining cake layers, syrup, and filling, including the top.\n\nFrost the sides of the cake with chocolate frosting.

    "presentation": "Being a big fan of Mexican hot chocolate, I just love the slight accent flavor of cinnamon in chocolate. This recipe for chocolate cake evolved with experimentation as I figured out how to achieve a light fluffy cake and infused it with a hint of coffee and cinnamon. Coffee enhances the flavor of cocoa powder, resulting in a more chocolaty cake. Cocoa powder is bitter on its own, with hints of fruit and spice that are detectable when you get a good-quality cocoa. Coffee has these same flavor elements, and a small amount of coffee in the batter will help these cocoa flavors stand out even more than they would on their own. Cinnamon adds another layer of richness that complements the underlying spice flavors in cocoa. Add a dollop of blackberry preserves in the center of the cupcakes.",

    "preparation": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup standard cupcake pans with paper liners.\n\nWhisk flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.\n\nCombine sugars and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, thoroughly mixing after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract.\n\nMix 1/3 of the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just combined. Mix in 1/2 of the coffee and 1/2 of the sour cream until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture alternately with remaining sour cream and coffee. Do not overmix. Fill the prepared cupcake cups evenly with batter.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until they spring back lightly when touched, 18 to 22 minutes. Let cool completely, 30 minutes to 1 hour.\n\nCore cooled cupcakes using a knife or cupcake corer, cutting about halfway down. Save cupcake centers for another use (such as for making a batch of cake balls).\n\nPrepare ganache. Add white chocolate chips and heavy cream to a large, microwave-safe bowl. Heat at 50% power until chocolate is melted and smooth, in 30-second intervals, stirring after each. Mix in crushed candies and peppermint extract until thoroughly combined. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, stirring often.\n\nPlace ganache in a piping bag or resealable plastic bag with a corner cut off. Fill each cupcake to the top with ganache. Allow them to sit until ganache firms up and doesn't \"smudge\" when pressed lightly with fingertips, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nPrepare frosting. Cream butter until smooth in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in 1 cup powdered sugar at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract, peppermint extract, and salt. Add heavy cream and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. If frosting is too thick, add more heavy cream--or if it is too thin, add more powdered sugar until frosting is a spreadable consistency that still holds its shape.\n\nPlace a small amount of frosting in a separate bowl and add yellow food coloring for the ear muffs. Divide remaining frosting in half. To 1/2 of the divided frosting, add cocoa powder and red food coloring to achieve an auburn color. Divide remaining white frosting in half again. Color 1/2 peach using a very light amount of red and yellow food coloring. Color remaining frosting red. Put each into a piping bag fitted with a coupler.\n\nArrange cupcakes on a large cake board or serving platter, starting from the top. Begin with 1 cupcake at the top. Follow with a row of 2 cupcakes, making sure they stay as close as possible. (If cupcakes slide around, affix a small amount of frosting to the bottom of them so they stick to the serving platter or cake board.) Follow with a row of 3 cupcakes, then a row of 5 cupcakes, a row of 4 cupcakes, another row of 5 cupcakes, and finally a last row of 4 cupcakes. Make sure the cupcakes are as close to one another as possible. If there are any large gaps, you can use large marshmallows, trimmed to fit, in order to fill them in and make a flatter, more cohesive surface to frost.\n\nBeginning with the top 6 cupcakes (the rows with 1 cupcake, 2 cupcakes, and 3 cupcakes in them), frost the hat portion of the cake using the red frosting and large round tip. Smooth center portion using an offset spatula, if desired. Use the peach frosting to frost the center 3 cupcakes in the row of 5 below the hat, leaving a cupcake on each side unfrosted for the ear muffs. Smooth with an offset spatula. Affix 2 dark chocolate chips upside-down for the eyes in the center of the peach frosting.\n\nPipe the nose below the eyes, and then the lower lip below the nose using the peach frosting. Frost the cupcakes on each side of the face with the yellow frosting for the ear muffs. To frost the beard, use the auburn colored frosting and cover the remaining unfrosted cupcakes (that contain a row of 4, a row of 5, and final row of 4 cupcakes) with a thin layer of the auburn frosting. Smooth frosting all over the \"beard-portion\" of the cupcakes until mostly smooth and flat. Place a star tip on the auburn frosting piping bag, and pipe dots of frosting along the side of the face, then pipe the mustache between the nose and lip, and add some swirls on top of the beard, if desired.\n\nAllow cupcake cake to sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature (or place in the fridge) to allow frosting to crust. Serve.",

    "presentation": "These molten chocolate cupcakes are simple and elegant, and they bake in under 10 minutes in a standard cupcake or muffin pan. The best part about these little beauties is that the cake batter is extremely forgiving: You can make it up to six hours before you plan to serve the cakes. Fill the pans with batter and refrigerate, but remember to remove the pan far enough in advance of baking to let the batter return to room temperature. Because they bake for only 8 to 10 minutes, pop these little cakes into the oven as you're clearing the main course dishes and making coffee.",

Stir in the graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, water, and cinnamon. Press the cracker mix into the bottom and about 1 in h up the sides of the prepared pie pan. Set aside.\n\nBeat the cream cheese and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the cream cheese mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last egg. Reserve 1/3 of the cream cheese mixture in a bowl. Pour the remaining 2/3 batter into the prepared crust.\n\nMelt 1/2 cup chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Stir in the reserved cream cheese batter. Pour the chocolate mixture into the pan over the white filling. Run a knife through the filling decoratively to create a marble look. Sprinkle the chopped maraschino cherries on top. Place the pie pan on a baking sheet.\n\nBake on the top rack of the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Continue baking until the edges of the cheesecake have nicely puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour. Turn the oven off and allow the cheesecake to rest in the oven with the door closed for 1 1/2 hours. Run the tip of a paring knife around the edges of the pan, set the pan on a wire rack, and allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes before placing into the refrigerator, and cooling 3 hours.\n\nHeat the cornstarch and reserved maraschino cherry juice in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until the sauce has thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside to cool completely. Pour the cooked sauce over the cheesecake. Sprinkle the halved cherries on top. Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons chocolate chip in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting. Drizzle chocolate over the cheesecake. Refrigerate at least 2 more hours before serving.",
